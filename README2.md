### some interview questions

- == vs ===
  Double equals is comparing just the value while
  triple equals is comparing both the value and the type

- Closure
  It essentially is a function calling a function within.
  So you will have a parent function that will have a child function.
  you can instantiate a variable on your first function.
  Then your return function will have access to it.

- Lexical vs Block Scope
  var is the traditional way which has sort of been deprecated with the addition of constant and let
  that uses lexical scope. Lexical scope is really refers to variable hoisting

- typeof
